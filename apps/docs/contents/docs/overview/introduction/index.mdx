`@nakarmi23/bs-ad-calendar` is a React-based, **headless** component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience.

## What is Headless Component?

A headless component separates core functionality from presentation, offering only the logic and interactions without predefined styles. This design gives developers full control over the appearance, allowing seamless integration with any CSS framework or custom design.

## Vision

Most developers share a common understanding of date systems like the Gregorian calendar, which are widely supported by existing libraries.

However, when it comes to regional date systems like the Bikram Sambat calendar, the options are limited and often lack the flexibility and functionality developers need.

This creates a gap, forcing developers to build their own solutions, which can lead to inconsistent, inaccessible, and non-performant components.

Our goal is to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive, open-source component library specifically designed for Bikram Sambat. We aim to offer developers a powerful, flexible, and accessible toolkit that simplifies the integration of these calendars into their applications, setting a new standard for custom date components on the web.

## Key Features

### Unstyled

Components come unstyled by default, giving you full control over the look and feel. You can easily apply your own styles to match your application's design system.

### Uncontrolled

Components are uncontrolled by default. They manage their own state out of the box, making them easy to set up and use without needing extensive state management.

### Developer experience

Built with developers in mind, the library offers a clean and intuitive API that simplifies integration, customization, and extension of components. With full TypeScript support, you get type safety and autocompletion, allowing you to catch errors early and write reliable, maintainable code. Inspired by modern design patterns, the library promotes modular composition, giving you the flexibility to build and customize components exactly as needed.
