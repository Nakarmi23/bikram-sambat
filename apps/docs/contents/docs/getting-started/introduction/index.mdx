description: An open-source React based UI component library for building Bikram Sambat and Gregorian Calendars and Date Pickers.
---

`@nakarmi23/bs-ad-calendar` is a React based component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience.

## Vision

Most developers share a common understanding of date systems like the Gregorian calendar, which are widely supported by existing libraries.

However, when it comes to regional date systems like the Bikram Sambat calendar, the options are limited and often lack the flexibility and functionality developers need.

This creates a gap, forcing developers to build their own solutions, which can lead to inconsistent, inaccessible, and non-performant components.

Our goal is to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive, open-source component library specifically designed for Bikram Sambat. We aim to offer developers a powerful, flexible, and accessible toolkit that simplifies the integration of these calendars into their applications, setting a new standard for custom date components on the web.

### Quick Start

You can create a new Ariadocs project using the command:

```bash
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

### Expected Output

When you run the CLI, you can expect an output similar to this:

```
Creating a new Ariadocs project in /path/to/your/project from the master branch...
Cloning Master (Full Documentation)...
Ariadocs project successfully created in /path/to/your/project!

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are useful for emphasizing key points or quoting external sources:

Feel free to use blockquotes to highlight important information or quotes relevant to your documentation.

## Code Examples with switch

Here a custom tab component from shadcn ui is used.

<Tabs defaultValue="js" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList className="">
    <TabsTrigger value="js">Javascript</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="ts">TypeScript</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="js">
  ```jsx {7} showLineNumbers
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'
 
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body className="container">
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )}
````
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="ts">
```tsx {11} showLineNumbers
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body className="container">
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )

```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
